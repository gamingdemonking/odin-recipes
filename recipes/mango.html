    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A silken blend of handpicked Alphonso mangoes—celebrated for their rich aroma and honeyed depth—folded into
        chilled organic whole milk and a touch of Madagascar vanilla. Gently whipped to a velvety texture, this
        indulgent shake is finished with a whisper of saffron and a delicate crown of sweet cream. Refreshing, aromatic,
        and decadently smooth—summer in a glass, reimagined.</p>
